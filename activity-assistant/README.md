# Activity-Assistant
Activity assistant provides a platform for logging and predicting Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in realtime for home assistant users. 

# Version
Notice that this is still an alpha release. I try to get a first stable version out before christmas. In the meantime there will be bugs. The most bugs occur when you analyze datasets without having any recordings.
