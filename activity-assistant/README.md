# Activity-assistant
Activity-assistant is a platform that streamlines the process of data collection. Selected devices and persons can be tracked. Using the android app, device readings are labeled with current activities. Furthermore activity-assistant supports the deployment of trained models running predictions in real-time. A homeassistant integration offers users a way to automate things based on activity predictions.

## Alpha version 
Notice that this is still an alpha release, meaning you will inevitably run into bugs. If there are problems, please open an issue because otherwise I will not notice. I am currently a university student, therefore there will be times where a fix takes longer because I am busy learning. 

## Features
For now you can collect data and generate useful statistics and visualizations. Although I build a proof of concept showing real-time prediction within Home Assistant, the prototype doesn't scale for general models. I am working on providing a generic interface for deploying models, a secure runtime environment as well as a proper Home Assistant component in the future.

## Audience
This Addon, at its current state, is intended for machine learning practitioners or developers to get started in this field. If this does not apply to you, the plots still provide insights in your interaction with your smart home.

## Feedback/Contact
So far I am doing this alone and to my knowledge there are not a lot of people interested in this area. I would very much like to exchange experiences, what worked what didn't work, so feel free to contact me under christian [at] meier-lossburg [dot] de.
