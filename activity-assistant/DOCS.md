# Minimal Documentation
I am working on a real docu which will be linked later. So stay tuned.


## Guide
- Configure activities and devices

- Finish the experiment and export your data 
- Use [pyadlml](https://github.com/tcsvn/pyadlml/) to load your data into a useful format
- Train your models, evaluate and repeat

## FAQ
- I can't connect my smartphone
    - Is the IP and PORT set correctly? Check the addon configuration and the config in activity-assistant.
    - This works for local nets. If you connect via Dyndns, etc you have to enable PORT-forwarding in your router.

## Known Issues
